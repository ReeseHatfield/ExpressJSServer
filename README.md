# ExpressJSServer

This repo contains an ExpressJS server I wrote for handling user login credentials. I wrote it for [Open POS](https://github.com/ReeseHatfield/OpenPOS), but felt like it deserved its own repository. It uses a custom non-standard cryptographic hashing algorithm and stores encrpyted data locally. It exists an simply an exercise, and is not to be used a secure alternative to something like SHA-256 encryption.

## Features
- ExpressJS Login Server
- Cryptographic Hashing
- Username/Password Database
- Database error handling
- Easy to use query system

## Contribution
Contributions are of course welcome.
